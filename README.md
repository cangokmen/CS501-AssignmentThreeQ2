# Assignment Three - Q2: Box Overlay with Badge

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a **profile picture with a notification badge** using **Jetpack Compose**. A `Box` is used to overlay the badge on top of the profile image, aligned to the **bottom-end corner** with `Modifier.align()`. A button allows the user to toggle the badge on and off dynamically.

This exercise shows how to combine composables (`Box`, `Image`, `Badge`, and `Button`) to build layered UI elements with interactivity.
